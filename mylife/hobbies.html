		<h1><u>Hobbies</h1></u>
		
		<h2> Listening to music/doing nothing</h2>
		<p> I love just relaxing and lying on my bed doing nothing and listening to music. I love listening to my Spotify playlist over and over filled with my favorite songs. I am pretty good at doing nothing. It makes me feel good and cleansed. This is something I definitely do when I come home from a long and hard day. <p></br>

		<h2>Baking</h2>
		<p> Baking is one of my favorite things to do with my brother and mother. It is really fun when baking a delicious treat. It is something we all do to bond together. From messing the measurements up from leaving the finnished project to burn in the oven, we all have a great time together. </br>

		<h2>Reading</h2>
		 I enjoy reading. It helps me escape from reality. It enhances my writing skills. It feels good to just read and pretend you are in a different world. My favorite author is Jodi Picoult. Her books are amazing. </br>
