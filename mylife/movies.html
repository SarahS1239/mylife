		<b>Little Miss Sunshine</b></br>
		Little Miss Sunshine is a sweet movie about a little girl who wants to become a part of a beauty pagent. This movie is filled with comedy and warmness. </br> </br> </br>

		<b>Aladin</b></br> 
		Aladin was my favorite movie since the first time I saw it. It made me see "a whole new world." "When wishing upon a star," I wish I had Iago as a sidekick. This movie is wonderful and forever my favorite Disney film.
