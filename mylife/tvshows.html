		<h1><u>Favorite TV Shows</u></h1> 


		<h2><b>Gilmore Girls</h2></b>
		Catching up on older TV shows on Netflix is honestly one of my favorite things to do. Gilmore Girls is an amazing show to watch.  </br>   </br>

		<h2><b> </b>Fresh Prince of Bel-air</h2></h1>

		This show is definitely is one of my favorites. The reason why I love this show is because of the comedy it carries through each episode. I could say that every episode is not a disappointment. </br> </br>

		<h2><b>Scrubs</h2></b>
		Scrubs is a classic doctor show. It is very funny. Even though the medical parts of the show is not that accurate, it's significantly entertaining. You should definitely watch it. </br>
